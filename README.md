# vipsdisp

Tiny C program to display an image with vips8 and gtk+3.

This is supposed to be a minimal example program rather than useful in itself.
See [vipsdisp](https://github.com/jcupitt/vipsdisp) for a more complete
(and much more complex) image viewer.

Run:

```
$ ./bootstrap.sh
$ ./configure 
$ make
$ ./vipsdisp ~/pics/k2.jpg
```
